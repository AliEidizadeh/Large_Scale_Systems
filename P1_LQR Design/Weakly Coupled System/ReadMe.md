This project explores the design and comparison of centralized and decentralized control strategies for a weakly coupled large-scale system (LSS). The system being studied is a two-input, two-output (MIMO) system represented by a transfer function matrix. The system has weak interactions between its subsystems, which is a common characteristic in many real-world industrial processes.

The first part of the project focuses on the centralized control design. The open-loop system is defined using transfer functions and then converted into its minimal state-space representation. Using this state-space model, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is designed. The Q and R matrices are chosen as identity matrices to penalize both the system states and control inputs equally. The LQR gain matrix is calculated, and the system is simulated over a 10-second period using MATLAB’s ode45 solver. The system starts from a non-zero initial condition, and the centralized controller successfully drives all the system states to zero. The control signals are smooth and remain within reasonable limits. A cost function is also computed to measure the performance of the control strategy, which integrates the energy of the states over time.

In the second part of the project, a decentralized control strategy is implemented. Instead of a single controller, each part of the system is controlled independently using local information. The overall system is broken into two smaller subsystems, and separate LQR controllers are designed for each. The decentralized gain matrix is constructed by combining these local controllers. The system is again simulated over the same time interval with the same initial conditions. The results show that the decentralized controller can also regulate the system states effectively, although the response is slightly slower compared to the centralized design. The control signals remain structured and practical for implementation. The cost function for the decentralized system is also calculated, and although it is higher than the centralized cost, the performance is still acceptable.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates that both centralized and decentralized LQR controllers can be used effectively for weakly coupled systems. The centralized controller provides better overall performance and lower cost, but the decentralized controller offers advantages in scalability and modularity, making it more suitable for large and complex systems. The results highlight important trade-offs between performance and practical implementation in control system design.
